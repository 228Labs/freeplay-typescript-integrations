# Freeplay Vercel AI SDK Examples

Ready-to-run examples demonstrating integration with popular frameworks:

- **[Next.js Example](./next/README.md)** - Next.js agent chat with simple tool support
- **[Node.js Example](./node/README.md)** - Node.js agent chat with simple tool support

## How to run

### Direct Run (Recommended for Testing)

From the `freeplay-typescript-integrations` repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm example:next      # Run Next.js example
pnpm example:node      # Run Node.js example
```

### Standalone Setup (For Your Own Project)

Each example can be copied out and used independently. The examples reference the published `@freeplayai/vercel` package from npm, so they work as standalone starting points for your own projects.

See each example's README for detailed standalone setup instructions.
